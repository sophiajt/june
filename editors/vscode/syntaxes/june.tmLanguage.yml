# todo: struct fields are getting source.june (see rust2.rs lines 1885 and 1888 with self.slice_head)
# you can capture this because function and method calls will always have parens, even if they are chained to another function by a dot, so you can match the case where a dot is followed by lowercase and then a word boundary without parens
