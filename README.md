# PREVIOUS README
# June, a gradual, safe systems language

## Goals

- Teachability | Learnability | Readability
- Efficiency | Productivity
- Systems and application programming

Also see the [philosophy](docs/philosophy.md) for more info.

## Participating in the closed alpha/beta

* How to file feedback
    * File feedback as issues on the repo: https://github.com/sophiajt/june/issues
    * When you file issues, please also submit the git hash of the revision you've built from

## Status

The June project is still in its early days of development. While we have developed a compiler in tandem with designing the language, both should be considered experimental and pre-alpha in quality. Significant changes to both the language and the compiler should be expected.

## Running the test suite

To run the June test suite, be sure to have the following installed:

* A recent `rustc`
* A recent `cargo`
* A reasonably good `clang` in your path

The June compiler outputs C code, which you can then build with a C-compatible compiler. The test suite assumes `clang` is the compiler that is available. (Note for Windows users: Visual Studio can install 'clang' as an optional install)

## How to compile

June currently provides some rudimentary support for building june projects. We don't yet support creating new june projects. June only supports binary projects at the moment, with a main.june file inside a `main` folder. The project root is marked by a `June.toml` file which is currently empty and unused, but will eventually contain metadata about the project including the output binary name. Inside of a properly setup june project one should be able to build by simply typing `june build`. Once the build step completes you should have a binary in `build/debug` called`main` which you can run manually.

```
project_dir/
    main/
        main.june
    June.toml
    .gitignore
    build/
```

Alternatively, the current version of June can be used compile June code to C by passing the filename directly such as with `june main.june`. After outputting C, you'll need to redirect this to a file, and then use a C compiler to build the June application.

## The June language

## Reporting issues

The best way to file issues is to file them through the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/sophiajt/june/issues).

## Roadmap

Our main goal with June is to build out an implementation of its initial design and to test it.

As we dogfood, we will likely change the design of the language where we see it doesn't meet the goals of the project.

We'll likely also work towards support in IDEs (using things like LSP) to make it easier to write larger June projects and get interactive feedback from the tools.
